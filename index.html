      <h2>Introduction</h2>
	<p>
	The World Wide Web (WWW, or simply Web) uses relatively simple technologies with sufficient scalability, efficiency and usability. As a result, it has become a remarkable information space of interrelated resources, growing across languages, cultures, and media.
	</P>
  <p>
  The Web is used as a platform to deliver services to end-users and enables business entities and applications to intercommunicate openly with each other over a network. The web is language-independent, uses message-driven communications and easily bounds to different transport protocols. As a result, web technology allows the exposure of physical devices as resources on the web using a Web of Things (WoT) approach. This approach can provide a standard means of internetworking among WoT resources running on a variety of platforms and/or frameworks.
  </p>
  <p>
  	The Internet of Things (IoT) is a novel paradigm that is rapidly gaining ground in the scenario of modern wireless telecommunications. The basic idea of this concept is the pervasive presence around us of a variety of things or objects – such as Radio-Frequency IDentification (RFID) tags, sensors, actuators, mobile phones, etc. – which, through unique addressing schemes, are able to interact with each other and cooperate with their neighbors to reach common goals.
  	</p>
  <p>
  As similar, in the emerging WoT, the Web is extended from its original document-centric design to an application layer for the real world. Real-world objects like consumer devices are integrated into the WWW by representing them as Web resources, which can be accessed using lightweight APIs based on the REST principle. 
 </p>   
 <p>
  Inspide of emerging WoT, overall proposed architecture at the initial stages of WoT research will have a severe bearing on the field itself and needs to be investigated. Most of the work relating to WoT architecture has been from the Web Services/SOA perspective or the wireless sensor network/IoT perspective.

      <p>
      	The main purpose of system architecture design is to configure how co-ordination can be technically organised in a globally distributed WoT environment. 
      </p>
      <p>
      	SWOTA(Simple Web of Things Architecture) satisfies the following design goals:

	<h2>Functional Components</h2>	
      <p>
       	A Simple WoT consists of mandatory components (a Thing as WoT enabled device) and interfaces exposed by those components. 
      </p>

     <section>
        
    <dl>
      <dt>WoT Device</dt>
      <dd>
      	a WoT device is a "Thing" which enabled WoT connectivity. a “Thing” in Web of Things (WoT) can be any object that has a unique identifier and which can send/receive web resources (including information and data) over a network. WoT devices are connected any devices to the Web and provide information about themselves or about their surroundings (e.g. information sensed by the connected sensors) over a network (to other devices or servers/storage) or allow actuation upon the physical entities/environment around them remotely.
      </dd>
      <dt>WoT Server</dt>
      <dd>WoT Server is a component resident in the WoT device and is the entry point to the WoT Enabler for all the requests coming from other component. The WoT Server exposes WOT-1, WOT-2, WOT-3, WOT-4 and WOT-5 interface.
		</dd>
      <dt>UA(User Agent)</dt>
	  <dd>
		A user agent is any software that retrieves, renders and facilitates end-user interaction with web content. User agents include web browsers, media players, plug-ins, extension and web applications that help in retrieving, rendering and interacting with web content. User Agent is a component resident in the network (outside the device). It has the responsibility for interacting bidirectionally with WoT Device by using WoT-1 interface exposed by the WoT Server. 
	  	</dd>
      <dt>Service Resources</dt>
	  <dd>
		Service resources (Cloud, Server, Web Resources) are one of the components residing in the network (outside the device) to provide external resources by using WoT-2 interface. 
		</dd>
      <dt>Sensors</dt>
	  <dd>
		Sensors detect and respond to inputs from the physical environment, and exchange sensing information by using WoT-3 interface.  
		<ul>
			<li>Passive sensors: a device that detects and responds to some type of input(e.g: the detection of vibrations, light, radiation, heat or other phenomena) from the physical environment. </li>
			<li>Active sensors: a sensing device that requires an external source of power to operate.</li>
		</ul>
    </dd>
	  <dt>other Thing (other WoT Devices)</dt>
    <dd>      	
		An external thing is another WoT device. It uses WOT-4 interface exposed by other WoT Devices for collaboration.
		<ul>
		<li>Device Type1: Low performance devices (e.g: Aruino ...)</li>
		<li>Device Type2: Middle performance devices (e.g: Beaglebone Black, Rasberry Pi ...)</li>
		<li>Device Type3: High performance devices (e.g: Smartphone, Tablet ...) </li>
	</ul>
	</dd>
    <dt>Event Trigger</dt>
    <dd>      	
		It is a component resident in the network (outside the device). Through WoT-5 interface, Event Trigger is responsible for sending push notifications.

	<p>
	In this section we elaborate on the security requirements for the WoT System. We expand on the basic requirements of confidentiality, integrity, authentication, and authorization and provide specific examples of potential threats that the system should be protected against.
	<ul>
		<li>Authentication</li>
		<ul>
			<li>An entity requesting a service may authenticate the peer entity as part of setting up a service and maintaining a service.</li>
			<li>The WoT system may support mutual authentication and one-way authentication.</li>
			<li>The entity authenticating the peer may choose from different security strengths to ensure appropriate level of security.</li>
			<li>Each service shall be able to perform authentication independently.</li>
		</ul>
		<li>WoT Device / WoT Server authentication</li>
		<ul>
			<li>The WoT System shall be able to authenticate the WoT Device or WoT Server. For WoT Devices supporting authentication and connected via an WoT Server, the authentication may be performed directly to the WoT System or to the authenticated WoT Server. </li>
		</ul>
		<li>Authentication of WoT service layer capabilities or WoT applications</li>
		<ul>
			<li>When there is a request for data or device access, the WoT Device or WoT Server should be able to mutually authenticate with the WoT Service Capabilities or WoT Applications from which request is received.</li>
		</ul>
		<li>Data transfer confidentiality</li>
		<ul>
			<li>The WoT System shall support appropriate confidentiality of the data exchange. A particular WoT application may or may not require the use of such confidentiality.</li>
		</ul>
		<li>Data integrity </li>
		<ul>
			<li>End points of the WoT System shall be able to verify the integrity of the data exchanged.</li>
		</ul>
		<li>Prevention of abuse of network connection</li>
		<ul>
			<li>WoT security solution should be such that it is not possible to illegally use the WoT Device for unintended applications.</li>
		</ul>
