	<h2>Definition</h2>
	<p>
	The World Wide Web uses relatively simple technologies with sufficient scalability, efficiency and utility that they have resulted in a remarkable information space of interrelated resources, growing across languages, cultures, and media.
	</P>
	<p>
	The World Wide Web (WWW, or simply Web) is an information space in which the items of interest, referred to as resources, are identified by global identifiers called Uniform Resource Identifiers (URI).

	<h2>Functional Components and Interfaces definition</h2>	
      <p>
       	The Simple WoT consists of mandatory component (a Thing as WoT enabled device) and interfaces exposed by those components.

     	<h3>Functional Components </h3>      
    <dl>
      <dt><code>WAFG(WoT Application Framework and Gateway)</code></dt>
      <dd>WAFG is a component resident in the WoT device and is the entry point to the WoT Enabler for all the requests coming from other component. The WoT Gateway exposes WOT-1, WOT-2, WOT-3, WOT-4 and WOT-5 interface.
		</dd>
      <dt><code>UA(User Agent) </code></dt>
	  <dd>
		A user agent is any software that retrieves, renders and facilitates end-user interaction with web content. User agents include web browsers, media players, plug-ins, extension and web applications that help in retrieving, rendering and interacting with web content. User Agent is a component resident in the network (outside the device). It has the responsibility for interacting bidirectionally with WoT Device by using WoT-1 interface exposed by the WoT Gateway. 
	  	</dd>
      <dt><code>Service Resources</code></dt>
	  <dd>
		Services resources(Cloud, Server, Web Resources) are the one of component resident in the network (outside the device) to provide external resources by using WoT-2 interface. 
		</dd>
      <dt><code>Sensors</code></dt>
	  <dd>
		A sensor is a small device that detects and responds to some type of input from the physical environment. Sensor is a component with WoT device (internally or externally) to exchange sensing information by using WoT-3 interface.
