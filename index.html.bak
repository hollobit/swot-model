      	This specification is a proposal for building a High-level Web of Things (WoT) Architecture Model.

    <section class='informative'>
      <h2>Introduction</h2>
	<p>
	The World Wide Web (WWW, or simply Web) uses relatively simple technologies with sufficient scalability, efficiency and usability. As a result, it has become a remarkable information space of interrelated resources, growing across languages, cultures, and media.
	</P>
  <p>
  The Web is used as a platform to deliver services to end-users and enables business entities and applications to intercommunicate openly with each other over a network. The web is language-independent, uses message-driven communications and easily bounds to different transport protocols. As a result, web technology allows the exposure of physical devices as resources on the web using a Web of Things (WoT) approach. This approach can provide a standard means of internetworking among WoT resources running on a variety of platforms and/or frameworks.
  </p>
  <p>
  	The Internet of Things (IoT) is a novel paradigm that is rapidly gaining ground in the scenario of modern wireless telecommunications. The basic idea of this concept is the pervasive presence around us of a variety of things or objects – such as Radio-Frequency IDentification (RFID) tags, sensors, actuators, mobile phones, etc. – which, through unique addressing schemes, are able to interact with each other and cooperate with their neighbors to reach common goals.
  	</p>
  <p>
  As similar, in the emerging WoT, the Web is extended from its original document-centric design to an application layer for the real world. Real-world objects like consumer devices are integrated into the WWW by representing them as Web resources, which can be accessed using lightweight APIs based on the REST principle. 
 </p>   
 <p>
  Inspide of emerging WoT, overall proposed architecture at the initial stages of WoT research will have a severe bearing on the field itself and needs to be investigated. Most of the work relating to WoT architecture has been from the Web Services/SOA perspective or the wireless sensor network/IoT perspective.
